# Blog Capstone

## Purpose
This is a two-part project. Part one is complete and was completed on 7/28/22. Part two is currently in-progress with no ETF (estimated time to finish) currently.

This was a simple project, with a few experiential goals here. They were to gain experience with:
Flask templating
Jinja
CSS
HTML

### Goals:
1. Implement simple API JSON data retrieval using [npoint](https://www.npoint.io).
2. Render each post title and subtitle from JSON on default route.
3. Create a "Read" link at the bottom of each post card that redirects to the actual post.
